The initial titles and graphics can really only be seen on a wide-ish window that is not being persistently formatted in a github preveiw, so do not be confused if it opens with a mess of pipes, underscores, and slashes.

Intro
-------------------------------

This is a real time (well, mostly) strategy game. Click on units, than order them to move, attack, or build. Noteable features of this project include a spherical world with temperature, weather, terrain, elevation, and various regions holding different resources and dangers. There is also an expansive unit AI, allowing many units to act differently, determining wether they run foward, hang back, or flee during a charge (or turn on your army if you give them reason). The game is also highly strategy oriented, therefore only high ranking (and very high cost) units will give you real time updates on their actions. Otherwise you have to wait until a report returns, after the mission has failed or suceeded. The game will also essentially slow down time when it is nescessary, allowing orders to be passed quickly when the right time comes. An example of this "right time" is if you discover that attack is immanent (which can be found very easily unless the other player attempts to be stealthy), time slows letting you give orders to your forces before the attack, setting up a strategy.

Unit AI
-------

note-you may tell units to follow any particular person. Otherwise they will carry on with their orders, and follow the highest ranking unit nearby in times of crisis.
